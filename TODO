Project Goals: IRR PowerTools 3.0
---------------------------------

* Develop a web-based frontend for IRRPT user operation. Features include 
  configuration management, a work queue for changes which need to be 
  processed, an integrated route history viewer, and integrated AS-SET 
  explorer and manual IRR query tools.

* Move to an all SQL backend for route storage and configuration, in 
  order to scale and reduce dependancy on external packages.

* Add tracking of the version of the prefix-list which has been deployed 
  to routers, sent to upstream providers via Nags, etc.

* More tightly integrate prefix list deployment code into the package. 
  This is tricky, since you need to query a db to know which devices a 
  particular customer has sessions on. We don't want to get into the 
  business of being a complete customer database, and we expect that 
  most serious users will already have (or should have) an existing BGP 
  customer and BGP session database which will probably not easily speak 
  to our code. This needs more work.

* Optimize code to reasonably support the automated and frequent 
  (e.g. hourly) polling and deployment of hundreds or thousands of prefix 
  lists. Optimize configuration deployment to pack multiple customers and 
  BGP session updates onto a single router update.

* Add support for automatic updating of bogon list from Cymru.

* Add per-customer AS-SET member exclusion capability, for handling folks 
  who have customers with broken records and who don't know how to fix it.

* Add object-specific configuration options which can be applied in place 
  of or in addition to the global configurations. Per-object options 
  include the whois server to query, bogon filters, e-mail settings, 
  etc.

* Add support for parallel WHOIS queries to improve transaction speed.

* Add checks to spot common PHP configuration issues which are not 
  appropriate for this tool (e.g. safe_mode, limited memory use, limited 
  execution time, etc).
