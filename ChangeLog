1.29 - 

 * Added v6 support... wip 

1.28 - June 8 2015

 * Making this version compatible with TORIX changes, such as: -q quiet
   mode, timezone support and memory limit support

1.27 - Feb 8 2008

 * Redesigned (and simplified) the CVS diff code. The options are now 
   "fulldiff" (basically the complete output of a normal CVS diff, that 
   you could actually use to patch a file), "plusminus" (stripped down 
   to only a list of prefix changes), and "english" (aka "Cogent Mode",
   for NOCs who can't quite figure out what the + and - symbols might 
   mean). This was supposed to have been done back in 1.20, but this 
   version actually makes it work.

1.26 - June 8 2007

 * Added support for Force10 prefix-list format. The style is JUST 
   different enough from Cisco to be incompatible, you have to enter a 
   hierarchy under the prefix-list declaration and then enter the permit 
   lines seperately, rather than stating it all on one line. Thanks to 
   Greg Hankins for pointing this out and providing the fix.

 * Added support for 32-bit (4-byte) ASNs. The #.# format (who's stupid 
   idea was that anyways :P) was being detected as an IP address and the 
   result of a route-set. Added an additional check to make it detect as 
   an object to be be further queried, not that it will help since it 
   seems the IRRd software (which is the only protocol we support, for 
   various reasons) doesn't currently like importing this format either, 
   but at least it won't be IRRPT's fault when it doesn't work. :)

   Thanks to: those wonderful euros who just had to actually go and try 
   those new ASNs out ASAP, thus killing all the Farce10 and JUNOS 8.3R1 
   boxes on the planet. Go go gadget incompatibility. :)

1.25 - May 27 2006

 * Added an option to automatically change uid/gid to a specified id if 
   run as root. CVS will not let you run as root, so you should have a 
   dedicated user anyways, but sometimes people forget.

 * Completely changed the way we process arguments, php getopt() sucks.

 * Fixed a plethoa of bugs in irrpt_nag. I don't know how you guys were 
   even using this before, or why no one told me how broken this was 
   before now. :)

 * Changed the default subject line of irrpt_nag, put the ASN info in 
   the front for a quicker read on narrow terminals.


1.24 - December 29 2005

 * Added an "ASN list" file which records the ASNs behind each object. This 
   may be used to implement some kind of AS-PATH filtering in the future I 
   suppose, though it really isn't the right tool for the job. Talked into 
   this evilness by Jon Nistor <nistor@snickers.org>.

 * Fixed a really silly mistake in the processing of "english" style output.

 * Added a new tool "irrpt_explorer", which queries and displays the 
   contents of an AS-SET in a hierarchal and recursive format.

 * Removed some unnecessary code in irrpt_eval.

1.23 - November 18 2005

 * Changed $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] references to __FILE__ to work around 
   some portability issues with certain PHP builds (like apparently, RedHat). 
   Pointed out by Joshua Sahala <jejs@sahala.org>.

 * Fixed the -p flag (preview mode) on irrpt_nag. It works better if you 
   actually have "p" in getopt(). Pointed out by Christian Malo 
   <chris@fiberpimp.net>.

1.22 - November 8 2005

 * Fixed irrpt_eval -a (aggregate) functionality. Pointed out by 
   Jon Nistor <nistor@snickers.org>.

 * Added support for ExtremeWare prefix generation. Submitted by Tom 
   Hodgson.

 * A documentation tweak noting that PHP >= 4.3 is required. Submitted 
   by Tom Hodgson.

 * Added a note regarding Debian's "aggregate" package to the README.

 * Got a little carried away getting rid of Nistor's strict errors. Rolling 
   some things back to continue supporting php 4, easier solution is just 
   not to turn on E_STRICT.

 * Added some example scripts for router configuration deployment. Updated 
   documentation to reflect these changes.

 * Nailed down a few bugs with caching results that had incorrect array 
   indexes following sort and unique. Extensive troubleshooting by Jon 
   Nistor <nistor@snickers.org>.

 * Added a quick optimization to only parse the exclusions file once (well
   most of the time at any rate).

 * A couple of minor bugfixes and documentation changes from the previous 
   release.


1.20 - November 7 2005

 * Added support for handling a route-set object, and revised the as-set code 
   to be a little more generic/graceful while handling it. Issue noted by 
   Jon Nistor <nistor@snickers.org>.

 * Added a new tool "irrpt_eval" which returns a simple plain-text list of 
   routes from an arbitrary IRR object, using the irrpt query engine. This 
   can be useful for diagnostics/quick lookups, and is similar to the 
   IRRToolSet tool "peval". Requested by Aaron Weintraub.

 * Fixed some class definitions to comply with php strict mode. Contributed 
   by Jon Nistor <nistor@snickers.org>.

 * When an IRR query fails, the query that resulted in the failure is now 
   displayed (verbose mode required). Nagged to death by Jon Nistor 
   <nistor@snickers.org>.

 * Added a config option for controlling the e-mail updates which are sent 
   when a route change is detected:

   irrpt.conf: ['fetch']['emailonchange']

   User can now specify whether to send emails for updated detected in the 
   "full" (unaggregated) route file, the "aggregated" route file, "both"
   (default), or "none". Requested by Jon Nistor <nistor@snickers.org>

 * Added an option for "english" language diff format. Apparently the Cogent 
   NOC can't figure out what "+" and "-" means, so "english" mode changes 
   the output to "Add" and "Remove" (and is the new default). There is 
   also an option to continue using + and - ("plusminus") but to remove the 
   full "diff" headers. The old behavior is retained under the setting 
   "fulldiff". Requested by Adam Rothschild.

   irrpt.conf: ['diff']['output_format']

 * Added a new flag "-p" to irrpt_nag, which enables preview mode. In 
   preview mode, the contents of the email(s) which would be sent are 
   output to stdout instead of being emailed. This allows you to 
   double-check the e-mails before actually sending them. Requested by 
   Adam Rothschild.

 * Changed the format of ['pfxgen']['default_pfxname'], and renamed it to 
   default_pfxstr. It is now handled as a printf()-style format string, with 
   one argument (the ASN). For example, to generate "CUSTOMER:1234" use the
   string: "CUSTOMER:%d". Requested by Pierfrancesco Caci.

 * Updated the distributed (but commented out) example exclusions.conf, just 
   incase someone decides to uncomment it without obtaining the current 
   exclusions list themselves.

 * A bunch of small misc. changes in formatting and alignment. Largely 
   requested by Jon Nistor <nistor@snickers.org>


1.10 - December 29 2004

 * Added an optional local cache for prefixes queried from an aut-num 
   record, under the assumption that many networks will have as-set 
   records which contain overlapping aut-num records. This will increase 
   memory usage a bit, but results in significantly faster queries from 
   the IRR whois servers for those with a large number of IRRDB entries.
   Cache is enabled by default. Suggested by Arnold Nipper.

 * Fixed a bug in the default CVS files which would cause an error 
   message when fetch is run from a directory other than the default 
   "/usr/local/irrpt".

 * Commented out the default bogon routes in the distributed exclusions
   config file, so users must choose to explicitly enable it. Hopefully 
   this will prevent the blind use of potentially out of date bogon 
   information, and avoid unnecessary whining on mailing lists every 
   time a RIR is allocated a new /8.


1.00 - December 26 2004

 * Initial public release.
